# Etch-A-Sketch
This project is about creating a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch. Drawing happens when you hover over a gridsquare, changing the colour of it. 

##Purpose
The purpose of the project is to practice DOM manipulation skills and the application of JavaScript methods. It is encouraged that any other relevant concepts be applied (especially if they haven't been taught yet).
